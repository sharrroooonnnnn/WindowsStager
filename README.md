# WindowsHelper

The code provided is written in C# and consists of two classes: CurrentSystem and Program.

The CurrentSystem class is responsible for checking if the program has run before, adding the program to the startup, checking if the user has administrative privileges, and attempting to elevate privileges if necessary.

The Program class is the entry point of the program and is responsible for downloading and decrypting a shellcode from a specified URL, allocating memory for the shellcode, and executing it.

The following is a more detailed explanation of the code:

CurrentSystem Class:

The GetConsoleWindow and ShowWindow methods are used to hide the console window if necessary.
The hasRan method checks if the program is already in the startup list of the current user by checking the registry key `"SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run"`.
The AddToStartup method adds the program to the startup list by copying the executable to a random location in one of the following directories: `C:`, `C:\Program Files`, `C:\Users<UserName>\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup`. A shortcut is also created in the user's startup folder and a scheduled task is created to run the program daily at 10 AM. If the program is already in the startup list, the method does nothing.
The TryAdmin method checks if the user has administrative privileges and, if not, attempts to elevate them by restarting the program as an administrator.
Program Class:

The VirtualAlloc method is used to allocate memory for the shellcode.
The Main method checks if the program is running with administrative privileges, and if not, attempts to elevate them using the TryAdmin method of the `CurrentSystem` class. It then adds the program to the startup list using the AddToStartup method of the `CurrentSystem` class.
A WebClient is used to download encrypted shellcode from a specified URL. The shellcode is encrypted using a simple XOR cipher with a key specified as a hexadecimal string.
The shellcode is decrypted and copied to the allocated memory using the VirtualAlloc method.
A delegate is created for the shellcode function using `Marshal.GetDelegateForFunctionPointer`.
The shellcode is executed using the delegate.
Overall, the code is designed to add the program to the startup list, download and execute a shellcode, and attempt to elevate privileges if necessary. However, it should be noted that the code contains several potentially malicious or suspicious behaviors, such as copying the program to random locations and downloading encrypted shellcode from a remote URL. As such, it should be treated with caution and not be run on any system where its behavior is not fully understood or authorized.
